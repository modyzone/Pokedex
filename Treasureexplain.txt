React 3.3 is soooooooo important!! React is the Frontend Developing 
2.7 Maintenance of Data integrity: When Data related to each other and for example: user exists can login normally and user doesn't exist cannot login, Reliable Data.
2.7 Organic Data: it means the Data are flexible like NoSQL so it is a dynamic data which have direct interaction.
2.8 Objects for the Sub documents: Keys and Values directly inside the object
* another point : Mongo DB should run and be exist before the Mongoose
* Body parser to Read input from user and how to write the (req) in the function 
Middleware how to pass data to the request to be updated
Req, Res, Error
Deprecated it means is not supported anymore and need to be updated.
3.2 Native Apps: Run outside the Browser: it has to installed inside the Computer or the Cell phone like Google Chrome and Whatsapp.
the function (fetch) is to recall the url in an Asynchrounous way so that the apps can accomplish other tasks in parallel until the longer task finish it's mission 
the .then function pass the response to the main function such as details to request the objects
the item types is an array so we request a for loop to loop into the array.
when the .then from any of this functions will not fetch from the begining then we will go directly to the .catch(function (e)rror

!!!!! the changed part in the movie_api folder in the index.js file:
in the get movies:
app.get('/movies', passport.authenticate('jwt', { session: false }), (req, res) => {
  Movies.find()
  .then( (movies) => {
    res.status(201).json(movies);
  })
  .catch( (err) => { 
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).send('Error: ' + err);
  });
});
